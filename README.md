# IG-Parser
Parser for IG 2.0 Statements

##

* Prerequisites:
 * Docker and docker-compose

* Start the IG Script Parser by running `docker-compose up -d`. Run `docker-compose down` to stop execution.
* By default, the web service listens on port 4040, and logging is enabled. 
* The service automatically restarts if it crashes. 
* Adjust the docker-compose.yml file to modify these characteristics.
